PTUtils's documentation!
===================================

PyTorch utilities for neural network research.


PTUtils is a PyTorch utility package designed for coordinating neural network experiments with dynamics and modularity in mind. Inspired by its Tensorflow sibling, [tfutils](https://github.com/neuroailab/tfutils), PTUtils provides functionality for:

- constructing, runing and monitoring dynamic neural network models
- retrieving data from multiple data sources interactively
- interfacing with common databases


PTUtils is compatible with: **Python 2.7**.
