Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend installing tfutils within a `virtual
environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__
to ensure a self-contained environment. To install tfutils within an
already existing virtual environment, see the System-wide Install section.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/neuroailab/tfutils.git
    cd tfutils;
    python setup.py install

Or, if you would prefer to install using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/neuroailab/tfutils.git

To activate the virtual environment, type

.. code-block:: bash

    . .venv/bin/activate

You will see the prompt change to reflect the activated environment. When you are finished, remember to deactivate the environment

.. code-block:: bash

    deactivate

Congratulations, you have installed tfutils! Next, we recommend you learn
how to run models using tfutils and walk through the MNIST multilayer
perceptron tutorial.
